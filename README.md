# AML-Assignment2
Deep Neural Network and Backpropagation


* Implementing the feedforward model (Question 1).
* Implementing the backpropagation algorithm (gradient computation) (Question 2).
* Training the model using stochastic gradient descent and improving the model training with better hyperparameters (Question 3).
* Using the PyTorch Library to implement the above and experiment with deeper networks (Question 4).
